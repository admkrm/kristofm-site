Let’s just get this out of the way: the latest iPad Pro is still the [best tablet](https://apple.com) you can buy, made even better by its improved camera and updated processor. Period. That being said, the newest addition to its list of Apple-made accessories, the $299-and-up Magic Keyboard, serves as both a sign of the iPad’s near-inexorable rise as the future of computing, as well as a bump in the otherwise fairly smooth road.

### The newest accessory

The newest accessory adds what many people have been clamoring for — a real trackpad — to the iPad Pro’s arsenal, and does a pretty good job of it. But for a tablet so versatile, its newest attachment is quite inflexible, and in so many ways. That’s not to say it doesn’t have its bright spots, but it would benefit from some much-needed design changes before it becomes a truly killer accessory.

It’s difficult to fault the refreshed iPad Pro, especially when you consider its heritage. The iPad has long established itself as a sort of platonic tablet, one that ditches cumbersome desktop software like macOS for iOS, and more recently for its tablet-specific spinoff, iPadOS.

### The new iPad Pro’s case

In the new iPad Pro’s case, not much has changed. It’s still got its killer high-resolution “Liquid Retina Display,” and still eschews ports of all sorts save for a single USB-C connection. The biggest changes are actually minor: an improved A12Z processor based on the previous iPad Pro’s A12X chip, and an improved camera module that takes cues from its iPhone brethren, with both a wide-angle and ultrawide-angle lens available for you to snap away. Are you going to use the improved camera, with its integrated LiDAR rangefinder for improved portrait mode photos and better, more accurate augmented reality apps? Probably. But taking pictures with an iPad is not exactly a priority for most.
